This HR Application is designed to manage employee records and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, using a layered architecture for clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

The application is divided into the following two key layers:

Business Logic Layer: The core of the application, this layer contains the business rules and logic. It processes user input received from the presentation layer, validates data, and applies business rules before passing it to the data access layer. It ensures that the application's functionality, such as creating new employee records or updating existing ones, adheres to the business requirements.

Data Layer: This layer manages all interactions with the database. It is responsible for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting employee data from the database. By isolating database interactions within this layer, the application ensures that any changes to the database structure or type do not impact the business logic or presentation layers.

By utilizing this layered approach, the application becomes modular, allowing easy maintenance, scalability, and the ability to swap out or upgrade individual components (such as the database) without affecting the overall system. The separation of concerns also ensures that each layer focuses on a single responsibility, improving code readability and testability.
